🧩 About the Project
Stor3Link is a B2B platform that connects companies in need of short- or long-term warehouse space with warehouse providers who have available storage capacity. Think of it as the ""Airbnb for warehouse space"" — designed for flexibility, trust, and automation.

The platform already has Google Forms for onboarding Space Users and Providers, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, a domain, and a clear roadmap. We now need a skilled no-code developer to bring it all together into a sleek, functional, and automated platform.

🛠️ What You’ll Be Doing
Build and structure Airtable bases to store user and provider data (connected to existing Google Forms or rebuild forms natively)

Set up automated workflows in Make or Zapier for:

Onboarding new users and providers

Transactional logic and payment routing

Profile verification and updates

Notifications (email/SMS)

Create a front-end website (Airbnb-style) using Softr, Webflow, Glide or similar:

Searchable listings of available warehouse spaces

Profile pages with ratings, logs, badges, and verification status

Login portals for both providers and users

Admin dashboard for monitoring platform usage, payments, etc.

Integrate Escrow-style payment flow (e.g., Stripe Connect):

Charge users per storage transaction

Distribute fees to providers minus platform commission

Apply cancellation/breach penalties if triggered

Help implement profile scoring, user activity logs, reputation systems

Ensure scalability and ease-of-use for future VAs and admin support

✅ Required Skills
✅ Expert in Airtable (formulas, relationships, views, automations)

✅ Advanced knowledge of Make (or Zapier)

✅ Proficient in no-code website builders (Webflow/Softr/Glide/etc.)

✅ Experience with Stripe or other payment gateway integrations

✅ Familiar with B2B platforms or multi-sided marketplaces

✅ Can build clean, mobile-friendly UI/UX

✅ Fluent in English, excellent communicator, and documentation-oriented

🧠 Bonus if you have:
Familiarity with GDPR / data security best practices

Previous experience with platforms like Airbnb, Upwork, etc.

Ability to offer guidance on long-term automation and platform scaling

We aim to launch a working version of Stor3Link by end of May 2025. Initial scope is focused on core features with future phases for optimization.

The goal is to remove manual cleanup, simplify the workflow, and produce a clean, export-ready dataset that integrates with RocketPrint for our direct mail campaigns.

What we need the tool to do:

When Redfin data is downloaded and imported into the tool:

    Auto-calculate average price and price per acre (PPA) across the dataset

    Mirror the structure of our current Google Sheets layout (we’ll provide a screenshot for reference)

    Extract and organize only these fields from the Redfin CSV export:

    Auto-sort the results from low to high based on price per acre (PPA)

    Auto-remove duplicates from the list

    Auto-calculate ranges and averages from the cleaned data

    Color-code outliers in the PPA column (e.g., if a property’s PPA is far above or below average)

Important notes:

    This tool does not replace our full pricing process — it’s meant to streamline repetitive manual steps

    We will provide a screenshot of our current sheet as a structural reference
