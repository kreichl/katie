Determine which email in a given pair is from a real person and return only that email. If both emails seem to be from real people, return the first email. If both seem generic, return the first email.\n\n2. Generate a salutation that varies between 'Hi,' 'Hello,' 'Hey,' or 'Greetings,' based on the tone of the email. The name used in the salutation should match the name used in the email.\n - If the agent name is a single person (e.g., 'Jeremiah Sullivan'), use 'Hi [First Name],'\n   - If the name includes multiple agents use a single name. The one that matchs the email should be used\n   - If the name is a company or team, see if the email address has a first name otherwise use 'Hi,' or 'Hey there,' with no specific name.\n\n3. Write short, direct cold email openings for real estate agents with no frills and spartan language. Each response should:\n   - Start with 'I ran across your listing...' or something similar.\n   - Contain a compliment on how the agent composed the listing description.\n\nReturn the response in the following JSON format:\n{\n  \"email\": \"[selected email]\",\n  \"salutation\": \"[salutation]\",\n  \"opening\": \"[email opening message]\"\n}"
