Healy doing a post-construction walkthrough with the Lowry family after the home was built in 1902. They might have hosted a neighborhood meeting in 1922 to gather support to build the Thomas Lowry 'Seven Pools' Park. The grand staircase might have been the site of Senior Prom photos from the last graduating class of West High in the 1980s. But the most recent story of this terrific Lowry Hill residence, the restoration back to a single family home, might be its finest. The large front porch is just waiting for summer evenings. Stepping into the foyer, you'll want to take a moment to take in all the splendid detail of the public entertaining rooms: incredible wood wainscoting, coffered ceiling, stained glass light fixtures. The expansive living room features a fireplace nook, and has built-in shelving and bench for a library-style gathering parlor - a place to linger and talk after hosting a dinner in the dining room, rich with detail, including three built-in display china cabinets. The kitchen is terrific, designed for serious bakers and cooks. The layout features a separate pantry nook, with tons of storage and counter space for a coffee bar, or prep - as it connects conveniently to the dining room. The main portion of the kitchen features abundant shelves for your favorite cookbooks or kitchen gadgets, and elegantly concealed pantry cabinets that surround the center island, a great gathering spot. Bright and warm, you'll love creating and hosting from this kitchen. The main floor has a study with beautiful ceramic tiled decorative fireplace, and adjacent full bath. Enjoy dining al fresco in the screened porch, just off the kitchen. Ascend the staircase, with its restored newell posts and balusters to the second floor landing, arriving at a comfortable family room. The second floor features three bedrooms. The primary bedroom has an en suite full bath. There is a second full hall bath for the other two bedrooms. You'll appreciate the dedicated walk-in dressing room near the primary bedroom. Just beyond is a walkthrough office, with fabulous original stained glass picture window overlooking the backyard. Following the back hallway that leads to the third floor suite, there is a charming seasonal porch that faces east, for great morning sun. The third floor has a wonderful feel, ready for just about any purpose you can think of, with its high ceilings, wood floor and natural light. In its previous lives, it has been a separate living space - and still has an exterior staircase. It's ideal for a guest suite, au pair quarters, or work from home offices - you even have a separate kitchen to take a coffee break. The third floor features four flexible bedrooms and two baths, and its own laundry. The lower level provides a casual hangout space, and would be a cozy spot for movie night, games and playroom, and exercise area. There is a laundry room and several storage rooms, plus a sauna and bathroom. The backyard has a two car garage, and green space that has a fire pit area, room for patio entertaining and garden. The current owners did extensive work to bring back cohesion of the floorplan to a single family home - restoring the main staircase of the home, using original elements that had been removed over time, and incorporating a main floor bedroom into the kitchen space. It's a great home, with so many creative living spaces to satisfy your needs. 1807 Dupont Avenue South - continue its story with your family's memories to come as its next chapter."
